Project Conclusion
This analysis reveals several key insights about the Titanic disaster:

Women and children first: The "women and children first" protocol was clearly followed, with female passengers having a 74% survival rate compared to just 19% for males.

Class mattered: First-class passengers had a 63% survival rate, while third-class passengers only had a 24% survival rate.

Family size impact: Passengers traveling alone had lower survival rates than those with small families (2-4 members).

Age factor: Children had the highest survival rates among all age groups.

Fare correlation: Higher fares (which generally correlated with higher classes) were associated with better survival chances.
